{"Name":"AWSSDK - Amazon Simple Storage Service","Id":2027,"Alias":"aws-s3-sdk","Description":"Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### AWS Mobile SDK for Xamarin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe AWS Mobile SDK for Xamarin provides a set of .NET libraries, code samples, and documentation to help developers build connected mobile applications for iOS, Android, Windows 8, and Windows Phone devices. Mobile apps written using Xamarin call native platform APIs so they have the look and feel of native applications. The .NET libraries in the SDK provide C# wrappers around the AWS REST API implemented by AWS services.","Version":"3.1.2.1","Summary":"AWS S3 SDK for Xamarin","QuickStart":"If you’re new to the AWS SDK for .Net/Xamarin, you’ll probably want to look first at [Getting Started with the AWS SDK for .NET/Xamarin](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforxamarin/developerguide/) which explains how to set up the SDK and how to get started using AWS Services from an Xamarin application.\r\n\r\nAfter you’ve set up the SDK, you can start working with the mobile clients for Amazon Web Services. The mobile clients are described in the service-specific topics. No matter which services you’re using, you should provide AWS credentials to your app via Amazon Cognito. The Amazon Cognito credentials provider is discussed briefly in the various mobile service topics, and at length in the [Amazon Cognito Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/devguide/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n\r\n- [**Xamarin Developer Guide**](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforxamarin/developerguide/) - For in-depth getting started and usage information\r\n- [**Code Sample**](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-net-samples) - Repository of example projects using the SDK.\r\n- [**AWS Mobile Forum**](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=88) – Ask questions, get help, and give feedback\r\n- [**API Reference**](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/latest/apidocs/Index.html) - For operations, parameters, responses, and examples\r\n- [**AWS Mobile Developer Blog**](http://mobile.awsblog.com/) - For updates and guidance on using the AWS SDK for Xamarin\r\n- [**Release Notes**](https://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/.NET) - To see the latest features, bug fixes, and changes in the SDK\r\n- [**Issues**](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues)  - Report issues and submit pull requests\r\n- [**@awsformobile**](https://twitter.com/awsformobile) - Follow us on Twitter","Hash":"3e2ba69b7e5f615d5c8980720bb0c571","TargetPlatforms":["ios","ios-unified","android"],"TrialHash":null}
